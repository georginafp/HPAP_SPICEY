	abstract = {Loss of functional β-cell mass is the key mechanism leading to the two main forms of diabetes mellitus — type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Understanding the mechanisms behind β-cell failure is critical to prevent or revert disease. Basic pathogenic differences exist in the two forms of diabetes mellitus; T1DM is immune mediated and T2DM is mediated by metabolic mechanisms. These mechanisms differentially affect early β-cell dysfunction and eventual fate. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the field, mostly delivered by studies on β-cells in human disease. These advances include studies of islet morphology and human β-cell gene expression in T1DM and T2DM, the identification and characterization of the role of T1DM and T2DM candidate genes at the β-cell level and the endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling that contributes to β-cell failure in T1DM (mostly IRE1 driven) and T2DM (mostly PERK–eIF2α dependent). Here, we review these new findings, focusing on studies performed on human β-cells or on samples obtained from patients with diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {The early stages of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are characterized by local autoimmune inflammation and progressive loss of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. Here we show that exposure to proinflammatory cytokines reveals a marked plasticity of the β-cell regulatory landscape. We expand the repertoire of human islet regulatory elements by mapping stimulus-responsive enhancers linked to changes in the β-cell transcriptome, proteome and three-dimensional chromatin structure. Our data indicate that the β-cell response to cytokines is mediated by the induction of new regulatory regions as well as the activation of primed regulatory elements prebound by islet-specific transcription factors. We find that T1D-associated loci are enriched with newly mapped cis-regulatory regions and identify T1D-associated variants disrupting cytokine-responsive enhancer activity in human β cells. Our study illustrates how β cells respond to a proinflammatory environment and implicate a role for stimulus response islet enhancers in T1D.},

Phenotypic traits were assessed at birth or at the age of 8 years. Ten polygenic risk scores (PRSs) per trait were calculated using the PRSice v2 program. For birth weight, we estimated two sets of PRSs based on two different base GWAS summary statistics: PRS-EGG, which includes HELIX children, and PRS-PanUK, which is completely independent. The best PRS per trait (highest {\textless}italic{\textgreater}R{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2}}$) was selected for downstream analyses, and it was treated in continuous or categorized into three groups. Multivariate linear regression models were applied to evaluate the association of the explanatory variables with the traits of interest.

Sustained maternal smoking was associated with lower birth weight and higher BMI and related traits ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-value \&lt;2.99E-02). We identified a gene by environment (GxE) interaction for birth weight between sustained maternal smoking and the PRS-EGG in three groups ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-value interaction = 0.01), which was not replicated with the PRS-PanUK ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}-value interaction = 0.341).

A comparative analysis with 15 immune diseases showed that T1D is more similar genetically to other autoantibody-positive diseases, significantly most similar to juvenile idiopathic arthritis and significantly least similar to ulcerative colitis, and provided support for three additional new T1D risk loci. Using a Bayesian approach, we defined credible sets for the T1D-associated SNPs. The associated SNPs localized to enhancer sequences active in thymus, T and B cells, and CD34(+) stem cells. Enhancer-promoter interactions can now be analyzed in these cell types to identify which particular genes and regulatory sequences are causal.},

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

We provide a solution in the form of an R/Bioconductor package tximeta that performs numerous annotation and metadata gathering tasks automatically on behalf of users during the import of transcript quantification files. The correct reference transcriptome is identified via a hashed checksum stored in the quantification output, and key transcript databases are downloaded and cached locally. The computational paradigm of automatically adding annotation metadata based on reference sequence checksums can greatly facilitate genomic workflows, by helping to reduce overhead during bioinformatic analyses, preventing costly bioinformatic mistakes, and promoting computational reproducibility.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is characterised by a prominent desmoplastic/stromal reaction. It is now known that pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the principal source of fibrosis in the stroma and interact closely with cancer cells to create a tumor facilitatory environment that stimulates local tumor growth and distant metastasis. Pancreatic fibrosis is initiated when PSCs become activated and undergo morphological and, more importantly, functional changes so that the rate of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition exceeds the rate of ECM degradation in the gland. It is now well established that pancreatic cancer cells activate PSCs leading to increased fibrosis. This chapter summarises recent advances in our understanding of the role of fibrosis in pancreatic cancer, with particular reference to the central role played by pancreatic stellate cells. An improved knowledge of PSC biology has the potential to provide an insight into pathways that may be therapeutically targeted to inhibit PSC activation, thereby inhibiting the development of fibrosis in pancreatic cancer and interrupting stellate cell - cancer cell interactions so as to retard cancer progression.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: We have previously demonstrated that islet stellate cells (ISCs) exhibiting a similar phenotype to classical pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) could be isolated from rat islets, where they may contribute to islet ﬁbrosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was designed to determine whether human islets also contain ISC. Materials and methods: Using standard explants techniques, human ISCs were enriched from freshly isolated human islets. Immunoﬂuorescence visualization of markers for PSCs(α-smooth muscle actin;αSMA), desmin, vimentin, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used to characterize the human ISC. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to assess the proliferation of ISC. The wound-healing assay and the transwell migration were used to assess the migration capacity of ISC. Immunoﬂuorescence against collagen typesI (col-I), collagen typesIII (col-III) and ﬁbronectin (FN) was performed to identify extracellular matrix (ECM) component synthesized by ISC. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation were tried to detected stem cell potential.
Results: In culture, ISC with triangular shape grow out from human islets. The passaged ISC expressed αSMA, desmin, vimentin, GFAP and was positive for col-I, col-III and FN. The proliferation and migration ability of ISC was signiﬁcantly slower than those of PSC. And both the human PSC and ISC were able to differentiate in vitro into adipocyte- and osteoblast-like cells.
Conclusion: Similar to our previous rat experiment, the current study shows that human islets also contain ISC which is phenotypically similar but not identical to human PSC. \& 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We posit this void fundamentally results from a limited understanding of immune-islet cell interactions within the pancreas and relevant immune organs, contributions of β-cells to their own demise, and epigenetic predispositions affecting both immune and islet cells. Because biopsy of the human pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes carries risk and the pancreas begins to autodigest soon after death, detailed cellular and molecular phenotyping of the human type 1 diabetes pancreas is lacking, limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of β-cell loss. To address these challenges, the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases established the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) to procure human type 1 diabetes pancreata for an extensive array of tissue-based, cellular, and epigenetic assays aimed at critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the local immune attack and loss of β-cells. In this Methodology Review, we describe how HPAP is performing detailed islet and immune cell phenotyping and creating publicly available data sets with the goals of an improved understanding of type 1 diabetes and the development of more effective treatments to prevent or reverse the disease.},

In this study, we use case studies to highlight the limitations of conventional peak-based methods for processing scATAC-seq data. These methods can fail to capture precise cell-type-speciﬁc regulatory signals, producing results that are difﬁcult to interpret and lack portability, thereby compromising the reproducibility of research ﬁndings. To overcome these issues, we introduce CREscendo, a method that utilizes Tn5 cleavage frequencies and regulatory annotations to identify differential usage of candidate regulatory elements (CREs) across cell types. Our research advocates for moving away from traditional peak-based quantiﬁcation in scATAC-seq toward a more robust framework that relies on a standardized reference of annotated CREs, enhancing both the accuracy and reproducibility of genomic studies.},

            Single-cell omics technologies have revolutionized molecular profiling by providing high-resolution insights into cellular heterogeneity and complexity. Traditional bulk omics approaches average signals from heterogeneous cell populations, thereby obscuring important cellular nuances. Single-cell omics studies enable the analysis of individual cells and reveal diverse cell types, dynamic cellular states, and rare cell populations. These techniques offer unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, enabling researchers to unravel the molecular landscape of individual cells. Furthermore, the integration of multimodal omics data within a single cell provides a comprehensive and holistic view of cellular processes. By combining multiple omics dimensions, multimodal omics approaches can facilitate the elucidation of complex cellular interactions, regulatory networks, and molecular mechanisms. This integrative approach enhances our understanding of cellular systems, from development to disease. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in single-cell and multimodal omics for high-resolution molecular profiling. We discuss the principles and methodologies for representatives of each omics method, highlighting the strengths and limitations of the different techniques. In addition, we present case studies demonstrating the applications of single-cell and multimodal omics in various fields, including developmental biology, neurobiology, cancer research, immunology, and precision medicine.},
